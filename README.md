# Portfolio-Projects
This is a repository that will hold my various Java projects, as I get back into coding.

All of my Java projects, until further notice, will require a JRE to be installed as a dependency. For this, go [here](https://github.com/Heaxeus/Portfolio-Projects/releases/tag/Dependecies).

Go here for the CLI Hangman, with 'words.txt' file: [Hangman](https://github.com/Heaxeus/Portfolio-Projects/tree/def8f285c8fa5ef06c3d0b1c90514a51bd53e500/Hangman/builds)
